# Challenge_Mrs_Fix_It
Unity gave the learner a challenge, a unity game that was broken. The object is the fly a plane through obstacles. The plane flies backwards, goes too fast, controls don't work and the propeller doesn't spin. I had to fix all of it. I also added a throttle button (space!) of my own accord cuz who doesn't wanna go faster? Link to play. Once more, don't go sharing it, this is just for learning purposes (also learning my way around getting playable stuff on the web).
