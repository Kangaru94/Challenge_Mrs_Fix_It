# Challenge_Mrs_Fix_It
Unity gave the learner a challenge, a unity game that was broken. The object is the fly a plane through obstacles. The plane flies backwards, goes too fast, controls don't work and the propeller doesn't spin. I had to fix all of it. I also added a throttle button (space!) of my own accord cuz who doesn't wanna go faster? Link to play. Once more, don't go sharing it, this is just for learning purposes (also learning my way around getting playable stuff on the web). 

New Update:
I thought I botched the code, I didn't. It was a problem with the browser, not my code. Lesson learned. Close and restart before editing your code for no reason. I left the old update for documentation of what an idiot I was on this day. The difference between the first and second version is now an addition input by the used (A-D keys) and improving the comments in the code.

OLD UPDATE:
So I botched the code somehow, though I THOUGHT I had it working last night. I uploaded the first (non-working) version and the second (working with comments improved) version for documentation's sake. The fixed code is the in player control file in the second branch.
