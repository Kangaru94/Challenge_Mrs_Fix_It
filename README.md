# Challenge_Mrs_Fix_It
Unity gave the learner a challenge, a unity game that was broken. The object is the fly a plane through obstacles. The plane flies backwards, goes too fast, controls don't work and the propeller doesn't spin. I had to fix all of it. I also added a throttle button (space!) of my own accord cuz who doesn't wanna go faster?
